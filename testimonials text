I love everything about your product. The simple problem you’re solving so beautifully. The care, with which the assets (the app icon 🥰) as well as the animations and basically everything else is designed. Amazing work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Wow, such a great experience so far. I already learned a lot of shortcuts. It will be a game-changer!

Really love the sets, I'm already learning and remembering new tricks after just a couple days.

Snapped up a bunch of deals from independent creatives yesterday! One of my early faves is mouseless.app It's already taught me lots of new shortcuts and is always just there in the menu bar.

Just purchased Mouseless and am loving it so far, have already mastered a few of the Apple commands that I didn't know existed.

Mouseless.app looks so organic This is the way software should be designed. @_philippkuehn and @hanspagel are peaking in terms of product design. It seemed natural for me to feature them, one more time, in the Hall of Fame of pages.xyz

This is such a great idea for an app. Instant buy 👍

I'm also very much into the design of mouseless.app + 1 for yellow + 1 for that custom scroll bar + 1 for that app icon + 1 for charging for useful software 👏 @juliusgehrig + @_philippkuehn
