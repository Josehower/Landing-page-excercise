# React Landing Page Clone Exercise

This landing page is not my design, despite that the intent of this project was shown how I can follow the design guidelines in any project.

The original page can be found on [mouseless Website](https://mouseless.app/)

by the way this project was created over a create react App boiler plate.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
